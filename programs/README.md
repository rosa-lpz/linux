# Programming

## GitHub Desktop

* Repository: https://github.com/shiftkey/desktop
* Releases: https://github.com/shiftkey/desktop/releases

### What is this repository for?

This repository contains specific patches on top of the upstream
`desktop/desktop` repository to support Linux usage.

It also publishes [releases](https://github.com/shiftkey/desktop/releases) for various Linux distributions:

 - AppImage (`.AppImage`)
 - Debian (`.deb`)
 - RPM (`.rpm`)

### Installation via package manager

You can use your operating system's package manager to install `github-desktop` and
keep it up to date on Debian and RPM-based distributions.

### Debian/Ubuntu

There are two APT package feeds available, both hosted in the US. You only need
to add one or the other here, as both of these are generated based on the
releases from this repository.

#### [@shiftkey](https://github.com/shiftkey) package feed

```bash
wget -qO - https://apt.packages.shiftkey.dev/gpg.key | gpg --dearmor | sudo tee /usr/share/keyrings/shiftkey-packages.gpg > /dev/null
sudo sh -c 'echo "deb [arch=amd64 signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/shiftkey-packages.gpg] https://apt.packages.shiftkey.dev/ubuntu/ any main" > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/shiftkey-packages.list'
```

#### [@mwt](https://github.com/mwt) package feed

```bash
wget -qO - https://mirror.mwt.me/shiftkey-desktop/gpgkey | gpg --dearmor | sudo tee /usr/share/keyrings/mwt-desktop.gpg > /dev/null
sudo sh -c 'echo "deb [arch=amd64 signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/mwt-desktop.gpg] https://mirror.mwt.me/shiftkey-desktop/deb/ any main" > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/mwt-desktop.list'
```

#### Installation

Once you have a feed configured, run this command to install the application:

```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt install github-desktop
```
## PosgreSQL
* https://www.postgresql.org/download/linux/debian/

PostgreSQL is available in all Debian versions by default. However, Debian "snapshots" a specific version of PostgreSQL that is then supported throughout the lifetime of that Debian version. The PostgreSQL project maintains an Apt repository with all supported of PostgreSQL available.
 
### Included in Distribution

Debian includes PostgreSQL by default. To install PostgreSQL on Debian, use the apt (or other apt-driving) command:
```bash
apt install postgresql
```
### PostgreSQL Apt Repository

If the version included in your version of Debian is not the one you want, you can use the PostgreSQL Apt Repository. This repository will integrate with your normal systems and patch management, and provide automatic updates for all supported versions of PostgreSQL throughout the support lifetime of PostgreSQL.

The PostgreSQL Apt repository supports the current versions of Debian:

    trixie (13.x)
    bookworm (12.x)
    bullseye (11.x)
    forky (testing)
    sid (unstable)

on the following architectures:

    amd64
    arm64
    ppc64el

Automated repository configuration: 
```bash
sudo apt install -y postgresql-common
sudo /usr/share/postgresql-common/pgdg/apt.postgresql.org.sh
```
To manually configure the Apt repository, follow these steps: 
```bash
# Import the repository signing key:
sudo apt install curl ca-certificates
sudo install -d /usr/share/postgresql-common/pgdg
sudo curl -o /usr/share/postgresql-common/pgdg/apt.postgresql.org.asc --fail https://www.postgresql.org/media/keys/ACCC4CF8.asc

# Create the repository configuration file:
. /etc/os-release
sudo sh -c "echo 'deb [signed-by=/usr/share/postgresql-common/pgdg/apt.postgresql.org.asc] https://apt.postgresql.org/pub/repos/apt $VERSION_CODENAME-pgdg main' > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/pgdg.list"

# Update the package lists:
sudo apt update
```

Install PostgreSQL: (replace "18" by the version you want) 
```bash
sudo apt install postgresql-18
```
